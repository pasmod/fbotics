Message templates offer a way for you to offer a richer in-conversation experience than standard text messages by integrating buttons, images, lists, and more alongside text a single message. Templates can be use for many purposes, such as displaying product information, asking the message recipient to choose from a pre-determined set of options, and showing search results.
