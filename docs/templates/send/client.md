## Client
In order to create an instance of the Client, a page access token is needed. 

```python
from fbotics import Client

client = Client(page_access_token="PAGE_ACCESS_TOKEN")
```

The client can be used to send requests (messages) to the recipients.

```python
from fbotics import Client
from fbotics.models.request import Request

client = Client(page_access_token="PAGE_ACCESS_TOKEN")
request = Request(...)
client.send(request)
```
