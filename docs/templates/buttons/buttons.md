Most message templates, as well as the persistent menu, support buttons that invoke different types of actions. These buttons allow you to easily offer the message recipient actions they can take in response to the template, such as opening the Messenger webview, starting a payment flow, sending a postback message to your webhook, and more.

For message templates, buttons are included defined by objects in the buttons array. For the persistent menu, buttons are defined by objects in the call_to_actions array.
